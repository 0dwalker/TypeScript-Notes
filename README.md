# TypeScript Notes Journal
You do not need to watch every video, but you are welcome to if you find it beneficial.  Keep track of your learning progress by summarizing each section and writing important code examples to reference at a later time to understand syntax.

In each section I will provide you with some leading questions to answer, either in your summary or which a pointed example.  As always, you have the option to pause the video and rewind, as a result up the speed to x1.25.

### 1 Getting started
-  What is the relationship between TS and JS?
-  Can the browser run TS?
-  What is the official TS website?
-  What should we type in bash to install TypeScript?
-  What should we type into bash to compile TypeScript?
-  What should you type into bash to compile all TS files in a folder?

### 2 Using types for better code
- What is the difference between a static typed var and a dynamic typed var?
- How can be be explicit about declaring types?
- Show some examples of variables in TS.
- What is a tuple?
- What is an enum?
- What is the type any?  When should you use it?
- How do functions use types for inputs and outputs?
- What is the type of nothing?
- Is NaN a number?  (This is so stupid...remember JS was made in 11 days)
- How do we write a function type?
- How do we write an object type?
- How can we store types, and use its alias?
- What is a union type?
- Explain why you might use a never type?


### 3 Understanding the type compiler
- Does the compiler compile code even if it warns you?
- What does the tsconfig file do? What can you change and what is the effect?
- Where can you find all the config options?

### 4 TypeScript and ES6
-  Which variable declarations are es6 or es5?
-  Explain block scope.  Is "let" block-scoped?
-  What is an arrow function?  Why use an arrow function?
-  Show a few examples of arrow functions, some with an implicit output and some where you need to return with curly-brackets. Some with inputs some with no inputs.
-  Show an example with default parameters.
-  What is a spread operator?  Why is it useful?
-  How does the compiler determine if the triple dots is a spread operator or a rest operator?
-  Show examples for destructuring arrays and objects.
-  Which symbols do we use for template literals?
-  How can we insert variables & functions into template variables?

### 5 Using classes to create objects
### 6 Namespaces and modules
### 7 Doing contract work with interfaces
